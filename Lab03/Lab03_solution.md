# Questions to Answer

## 1. Preparation


Choose a sandboxing solution, some recommended ones includes the following.

- [Cuckoo (Bonus point if you set up Cuckoo in an isolated VM)](https://cuckoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/host/installation/)
- [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/)
- [Any.run](https://app.any.run/)
- [Intezer Analyze](https://intezer.com/intezer-analyze/)
- [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/#windows)

---

### Solution:

I will choose third choice [Any.run](https://app.any.run/) as we practice with it during lab.
I created an account on it.
here is the screenshot of it:

## 2. Let's get some malware

Select a malware that you want to analyse in the sandbox selected in step 1.
>
- You can download some malware/ransomware from the internet. For example [TheZoo](https://https//github.com/ytisf/theZoo), [MalwareBazaar Database](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/). You can also check your email for any spam with malicious attachment.

- Don't select the same malware used in the classwork.
- Be careful when you run them, these are real malware.

### Solution:

I searched in the [MalwareBazaar Database](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/), and I will use this [Malware](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/01ec7b1066df7c55e262dc375bff5fd13a1fc9706c3db4b3522ac8b9d2453b52/)

## 3. Sandbox analysis

Run your malware in the sandbox.

- See what kind of traces, artifacts, connections your sandbox detects.
- Analyze the behavior of the malware, and write about what the malware does and the goals of the malware.
- Does the malware have some sandbox detection? If yes, try to detect and defeat the techniques used for that.


### Solution:


1. Firstly I downloaded the malware as zip, unzip, upload the file to the [Any.run](https://app.any.run/) , and I will set the configuration:

- after unzip it:

- we add more time for analyzing.

- fourth process:

- fifth process it's trying to sleep to evasion detection, but we got it with increasing the time and without it:

3.  I run it without more time, and I got same results. So the malware didn't have sandbox detection.

4. Links to reports generated by the tool:

   [Any.run](https://app.any.run/tasks/9e47862f-89ea-491c-b18a-ca3ec27bca42)

   [Without increasing the time](https://any.run/report/01ec7b1066df7c55e262dc375bff5fd13a1fc9706c3db4b3522ac8b9d2453b52/8ee8109d-d072-42d3-ab8c-98de8991229c)
   [With increasing the time](https://any.run/report/01ec7b1066df7c55e262dc375bff5fd13a1fc9706c3db4b3522ac8b9d2453b52/9e47862f-89ea-491c-b18a-ca3ec27bca42)

## 4. Remediation


- Suggest remediation actions for eradicating the malware from compromised endpoints. Include this in your malware analysis report.


> Note that generic recommendations will not be accepted. You need to suggest very specific steps that align with the results from your analysis.


For example:

- Remove the executable dropped at C:\Program Files\dotnet\malware.exe ✅
- Remove the dropped executable ❌
Another example:

- Create a rule on the network firewall to block IP address xx.xx.xx.xx ✅
- Create a firewall rule ❌
